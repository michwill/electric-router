# What a quote costs

Measured on ethereum at block 25,841,728, USDC -> WETH 100,000, with the Rust
solver on. Reproduce with `scripts/bench_quote.py`.

## How to measure it at all

Three rules, each learned by getting it wrong first. They are in the harness
because none of them is obvious and all three change the answer.

**Min, not median.** Sequential arms on this machine drift 30 ms between them,
and whichever ran second lost -- whichever it was:

```
run 1   AFTER 101.84   BEFORE 102.32
run 2   BEFORE 134.30  AFTER  134.75      arms swapped, result flips
```

The min is the least contaminated sample. The median measures the machine.

**CPU, not wall.** `process_time` drops the scheduler. The ratio is printed so
a run with network still in it is obvious rather than quietly averaged in.

**Ablation, not attribution.** cProfile charges per call, so a function called
many times reads several times its cost. `copy.copy` looked like 8% of a quote
and is 2%: `copy._reconstruct` makes 26,240 tiny `setattr` calls and the
profiler charged each of them. Every number below comes from a span around real
work, or from a counter, or from turning something off.

## Where it goes

A warm quote is **95 ms and `cpu/wall` is 0.999** -- there is no network left in
it. The stages do not overlap; they account for 91 of the 95.

| stage | ms | share |
|---|---|---|
| candidates | 40.66 | 42.6% |
| refine | 18.63 | 19.5% |
| split | 17.29 | 18.1% |
| direct | 3.49 | 3.7% |
| solve | 3.29 | 3.4% |
| verify · legs · realize · seed · graph · impact | ~7.8 | 8.2% |

Cutting across those:

| | ms | note |
|---|---|---|
| Rust solver | 20.4 | 41 solves at 497 us; **already native** |
| pool models | ~15 | 1,641 evaluations of Python integer arithmetic |
| FFI crossing | 0.6 | masks in, buffers out; not the cost |
| Python orchestration | ~59 | everything else |

**37 of the 41 solves come from `candidates.resolve`** -- the drop-arc, pin
sweep and conflict-repair families -- at 484 us each. Four are the route.

## What a port buys, measured rather than estimated

`rust/proto` replays a frozen quote with no Python in it: `scripts/dump_quote.py`
writes the solver's own index space, the base solution, and every candidate
solve exactly as it was asked, warm start and bans and pins.

| | Python | Rust | how |
|---|---|---|---|
| the 37 solves | 18.1 ms | 17.0 ms | same code both sides |
| realising 18 candidates | ~4 ms | 0.05 ms | prototype; a skeleton, so a floor |
| `StableSwap.get_dy` | 9.30 us | 1.13 us | 382 vectors, 60 pools, 0 wrong |

`U256` against `f64` is 1.13 us against 0.07 -- sixteen times -- and it does not
matter: 1,641 evaluations is 1.9 ms exact against 0.1 approximate, on a 95 ms
quote. The exact width costs under two milliseconds once it is out of Python
and buys a bound that agrees with the chain to the wei.

## The shape of what is left

The remaining orchestration is **diffuse**, which is the finding that decides
the strategy. Inside `refine`:

```
_recalibrate 3.62   plan_sized 2.52   seed_subgraph 2.06   _assemble 2.03
merge 1.28   collect 1.04   price_impact 0.81   direct_candidates 0.44
```

Nine functions, none dominant, and `split` looks the same -- 18.6 ms of which
the ascent, the one part already in Rust, is 0.95. There is no single function
worth porting. **Port whole stages or nothing**: the candidate prototype took
40.7 ms to 17.05 by moving the loop, not by moving a function out of it.

A whole-pipeline port lands a quote near 25 ms, of which 17 is the solver.

## What 9 ms would take

An arbitrage desk reports 9 ms a quote. Our solver alone, already native, is
20.4 ms -- 2.2x their whole budget -- so it is not this problem solved faster.
`scripts/candidate_sweep.py` measures what the difference buys:

| pair | budget 8 | budget 16 | ms saved by stopping at 8 |
|---|---|---|---|
| USDT>tBTC | 0.00 bp | 0.00 bp | ~0 |
| WETH>USDC | 0.00 | 0.00 | 24 |
| USDC>WETH | 3.45 | 0.34 | 26 |
| crvUSD>WETH | 2.19 | 0.87 | 27 |

On half the pairs the tail of the ballot buys nothing; on the other half it
buys 2.19 to 3.45 bp, which is 22 to 35 dollars on a 100,000 trade for 26 ms
that costs nothing in gas. 9 ms is that trade declined -- the right call for a
bot, the wrong one for a router quoting a user's swap.
